     May the Father judge him justly. Can a man still be brave if heâ€™s afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave.It's ten thousand miles between Kings landing and the wall. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good. Each should have its own reward. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. More pigeon pie, please. Words are like wind. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. The battle of the redgrass field. The rains of castamere. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. Pay the iron price. The War of the 5 kings. I would like a trial by combat. What is dead may never die. I would like a trial by combat. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. The winds of Winter. Pay the iron price. The War of the 5 kings. The War of the 5 kings. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. The War of the 5 kings. The tourney of Ashford Meadows. Fire and blood. What is dead may never die. Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days. Lucky for the ladies. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. May the Father judge him justly.
